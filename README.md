# weather-forecast
This web app uses the 7Timer API to get a 7-day weather forecast for a city using its longitude and latitude.
Bootstrap is used for styling the application index page.
JQuery is used to read a JSON file listing Cities, Countries, and their longitudes and latitudes.
After selecting a city, a call is sent to the 7Timer API to retrieve weather information for the next 7 days.
The application uses this information to show the forecast for each day as cards listing the date, temperature
in either Celcius of Fahrenheit, and images representing the weather for that day.
